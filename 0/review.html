<h1>Guilded - First Encounter</h1>
<h2>What is it?</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.guilded.gg/">Guilded</a> is a chat service/platform in which users from all over the world can get together, share ideas and moments, schedule game times and more!</p>
<p>It is very similar to its competitor, <a href="https://discord.com/">Discord</a>. In both platforms you can get together with your friends, talk through voice chat, and get together to have a good one.</p>
<h2>Focused for Guilds, Teams and Communities</h2>
<p>I, too, was in the fence; why use Guilded when you could keep using Discord? <b>what sets Guilded apart</b>? Oh, let me tell you. <i>A lot</i>.</p>
<p>Guilded was made specially to make <b>guilds</b> (hence the name) or groups of people focused on the same goal as a team, be it <i>winning</i>, be it <i>chilling</i>, be it <i>finally organizing those schedules for a <a href="https://dnd.wizards.com/dungeons-and-dragons/what-is-dd">D&D</a> game</i>, there are so many features that make all of this more practical.</p>
<h3>Distinguishing Features</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p><b>Server Overview:</b> Chat servers (in which you get together with your group of friends) have a main page, the <b>server Overview</b>, in which you can see server announcements, recent member activities and <i>leaderboards</i>!</p>
        <p>The server administrator (or members with permission) can use this page to make announcements without having to create an announcement channel.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><b>A public and a private side:</b> All servers are public, but only what the <b>administrators</b> set up to be public will be public. This allows all servers to have a public and a private side to them, having their team conversations private to the public, and having something to show to the world.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><b>Server Applications:</b> Servers can be public to join, too, but some <b>guildmasters</b> will want some kind of test for the entrants of their guild. They can set up applications, which are forms that new to-be members must fill to apply and join the server.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><b>Groups:</b> A server has a general group, where all members have access to its base features, but the server can be divided into sub-servers called <b>groups</b>, which are usually teams within the guild, but are not locked to be that.</p>
        <p>Each group can be organized into hobbies. In my server, there's one group for <a href="http://pvp.net">League of Legends</a>, and another group for Dungeons and Dragons.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><b>More and More Diverse channel types:</b> Discord is locked to voice chat, text chat, and announcement chat. Oh no no no that is <b>JUST THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>You got <b>STREAM</b> channels where everyone (with permission) can chat and share their games or work; and you don't <i>need</i> to be inside this channel to see the stream, allowing you to chat with your friends on a voice chat while watching a stream from the stream chat.</p>
            <li>You got <b>CALENDAR</b> channels where event managers can schedule events, invitations, reminders, everything for an up and coming tournament or other kind of happening.</p>
            <li>You got <b>FORUMS</b> where you can start threads and talk about a topic, and reply to eachother in an organized manner. Pinning topics to the top is also a good idea so new people can see rules or other topics of interest.</p>
            <li>You got <b>CHECKLISTS</b> where the <i>TEAM</i> can mark stuff with a reminder, set as done, and have a path forward with a sense of <i>pride and accomplishment.</i></p>
            <li>GOD BLESSED <b>DOCS</b> where your guild can set up a <b>WIKI</b> if they so desire! Other group chats like <a href="https://aminoapps.com/">Amino</a> would have loved having features like this to build and share information about the guild, team, or otherwise group</p>
            <li>Finally, you got <b>MEDIA</b>, folders to share evidence of the latest crime the group commited... wait what? no! this is where your team can store your favourite <b>MEMES</b>, <b>ART</b>, <b>LEAGUE OF LEGEND ONESHOTS</b>, <b>D&D SESSION VODS</b>, just everything you could think of could come HERE!</p>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>What the previous pro <i>really</i> means:</b> Bot creators will have lots more POWER to do with their bots what they desire. Save information? check. Save configurations? check. Make missions? check. Make character sheets? check. Check checks in the checklist? check.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Support for chat XP out of the box:</b> Many servers use some kind of bot to measure how active their members have been on their server. Guilded does this FOR YOU! and everything is already pre-set up, you just gotta make roles and rewards and it's there for you! Waiting!
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><b>Subscriptions:</b> Hold on hold on hear me out HEAR ME OUT! You got <a href="https://www.patreon.com/">Patreon</a>-like features up in this app!</p>
        <p>If you are the leader of a great community, your community can pay <i>you</i> a subscription to help both you and the server out, while at the same time awarding them custom roles or whatever other prizes you have set up for them!</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><b>An integrated Audit Log:</b> This is slightly more technical, but some servers depend on a bot to log whatever happens inside. Guilded comes packed with one out of the box, so you don't need a bot to manage that for you.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><b>Voice Chat Tweak; Whispering:</b> You can now whisper in VOICE! just select to which group you want to whisper to and what you say will only be directed to them!</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><b>Voice Chat Tweak; In-VC Text Chat:</b> Allowing you to have a text chat IN the voice chat, and not needing a secondary <i>mic broke</i> chat, keeping everything organized!</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><b>Voice Chat Tweak; Voice Rooms:</b> This allows people to join the voice chat, and have a main moderator speaking to everyone at once, while the ones in the rooms can only talk to themselves. This, again, is very, very useful for managing a crouded VC</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><b>Such good SFX:</b> Yeah, a whole section just praising the thing's sound effects. They sound oh so good!</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>Y'aint tellin' me something, Guilded's issues</h2>
<p>Well... kind of. But I'm telling you now!</p>
<p>As of right now, day of publication, Guilded's bot support is lackluster, so auto moderators are not a thing. This is holding so many people back from using Guilded for large communities it's kind of absurd</p>
<p>Also, as of right now, the app is un optimized in big servers. Like BIG bad optimization. Like <i>1.4 GB RAM</i> consumed just for having the biggest server loaded. It's not an issue on smaller servers.</p>
<p>The team is, however, hard at work on fixing all these issues; they are aware what makes a good product and are working their butts off to get the best chat ever out.</p>
